# Behavioral Cloning for Autonomous Driving in Simulation

Behavorial Cloning allows a machine to imitate how a human drives a vehicle. The system 
learns an end-to-end deep learning model which takes each video frame as input and 
generates a control output. For the control output, only the steering angle is generated 
by the deep learning model and the speed is being maintained by a PD Controller. All these 
are done in a simulator. Below is the demo video of a vehicle running autonomously in the 
simulator. The vehicle can stay at the center of the lane for very challenging roads most of the time.
